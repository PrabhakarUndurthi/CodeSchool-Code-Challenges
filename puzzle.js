 /*

The folks over at Poplar Puzzlers need an array of functions for one of their puzzles. Theyâ€™ve requested your help in making the array, which they would like to be called puzzlers. The cells of the array should each contain a function, and these functions are listed here in order:

Returns 8 less than 3 times an input.
Returns the cube of the sum of an input and 2.
Returns 9 less than the result of an input squared.
Returns the remainder after an input is divided by 4.

 var puzzlers = [
  function ( a ) { return 3*a - 8; }, 
  function ( a ) { return (a+2) * (a+2) * (a+2); }, 
  function ( a ) { return a * a - 9; },
  function ( a ) { return a % 4; }
];
